# Dot Files

This is a small collection of my dotfiles, to help me keep them consistent across machines.
No fancy installation yet, just need to manually copy things to the right places.

If they are a bit of a mess, it's because I work across MacOS, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD. Putting it on GitHub is my first step towards making things a bit more automated and consistent. 

Useful sources I have used for inspiration include:
